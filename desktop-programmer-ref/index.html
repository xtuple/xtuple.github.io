    <title>xTuple ERP Programmer Reference</title>
  </head>
  <body><p>One of the advantages of working with xTuple ERP, and open source
  software in general, is that you can change it. Add to this the ability to
  write scripts and packages for xTuple ERP and you have a lot of flexibility
  on how to modify or extend the core application. However, wIth an
  application as large and complex as this, documentation of the internals is
  important. Even for C++ experts, there is just too much code to understand
  everything about the application without some help.</p><p>The following
  links take you to <i>The xTuple ERP Programmer Reference</i> for different
  versions of xTuple ERP:</p><ul>

    </ul><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>When you click on one of the links above,
  you'll see an introductory page with several tabs across the top:</p><dl>
      <dt>Main Page</dt>
      <dd>Clicking on this tab will always take you back to the
      introduction.</dd>
      <dt>Related Pages</dt>
      <dd>The Classes tab lets you look at the documentation based on either
      the name of the C++ class or other data structure, descriptions of the
      classes, the class inheritance hierarchy (which classes are derived from
      which others), or the names of class members.</dd>
      <dt>Modules</dt>
      <dd>Modules are parts of the source code that we have documented as
      belonging together, regardless of file names or position in the
      directory structure.</dd>
      <dt>Classes</dt>
      <dd>This is a list of all publicly available classes in the code. Most
      windows and some widgets are represented in this list twice, once for
      the .cpp source file and a second time as the user interface class. Qt
      and xTuple ERP use multiple inheritance - the C++ class containing the
      business and control logic is in the .cpp file and inherits the widgets,
      layouts, and signal/slot connections from a separate corresponding class
      generated from the .ui file.</dd>
      <dt>Examples</dt>
      <dd>The examples are a handful of JavaScript files referred to in the
      Programmer Reference showing how to access and expand desktop client
      functionality through extensions.</dd>
    </dl><p>Probably the best way to start using this documentation is to pick
  a particular window that you want to change. Then look through the Class
  List on the Classes tab for the most likely internal name for that window
  (see the <a
  href="https://github.com/xtuple/qt-client/wiki/Hacking-the-xTuple-Desktop-Client-Core#finding-what-to-change">qt-client
  wiki</a> for another way to get this name). Once you have a good candidate,
  you'll likely see two lines with that same name, one just plain and the
  other starting "Ui:". For example, if you are looking for the window that
  lets you create or edit a currency exchange rate, search for "currency" on
  the Class Index. You should find the following (and a few other
  lines):</p><ul>
      <li>currencyConversion (Ui) - the user interface definition (window
      layout and widgets) for the exchange rate window</li>
      <li>currencyConversion - the actions defined for the exchange rate
      window</li>
      <li>currencyConversions (Ui) - the window layout and widgets for the
      window listing all of the defined exchange rates</li>
      <li>currencyConversions - the actions defined for the window listing all
      of the defined exchange rates</li>
    </ul><p>Click on <code>currencyConversion</code>. The resulting page shows
  a handful of member functions and slots. These are the functions and slots
  defined specifically for the currencyConversion window (class). Near the top
  of the page, however, you'll see a List of all members link. Clicking here
  will bring up a list of all members of the currencyConversion class,
  including those that it inherits from its parent classes, QDialog and
  Ui_currencyConversion (which in turn comes from
  Ui::currencyConversion).</p><p>Now you can find the internal names of the
  pair of dates (a DateCluster widget called <code>_dateCluster</code>), the
  field for entering the exchange rate, and other widgets. If you want to
  learn more about what a particular item on the list is for, click the name
  of the item. For example, clicking on <code>_rate</code> will show you the
  documentation for the <code>_rate</code> button. If you want to find out
  what you can do with the <code>_rate</code> field (e.g., can you hide it?),
  click on the <code>XLineEdit</code> link.</p><p>The programmer reference
  documentation is sparse. The addition of details is a work in progress. If
  you would like to help with this effort, please send email to <a
